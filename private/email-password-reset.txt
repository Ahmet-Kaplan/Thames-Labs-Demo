Dear {{name}},

You have made a request to reset your RealTimeCRM password.

By clicking the link below you will be able to enter a new password which you can use to access RealTimeCRM from now on:

Please ensure the new password that you choose is something that you can remember but is not too easy for others to guess. A combination of words and numbers is often ideal.

If you did not request a password reset then please ignore this email. No changes have been made to your account and you will be able to continue to login as normal.

Should you continue to have problems logging in then you can contact us [http://realtimecrm.co.uk/about/] for help and advice.

We hope you're enjoying your RealTimeCRM experience.

Best wishes,
The RealTimeCRM Team
