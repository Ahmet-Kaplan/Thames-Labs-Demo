        <div class="modal-body">
          <h4>Is it secured?</h4>
          The subscription process is made through an external system called 
          <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>. 
          This system is <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-kind-of-security-does-stripe-have-in-place" target="_blank">highly secured</a> 
          both for you and for us.

          <h4>How does this work?</h4>
          When you entered your card details, they are securely and direclty transferred to Stripe by https (make sure you see the padlock in your address bar).
          Using a public encryption key, Stripe then encrypts it and send it back as a <em>token</em>. This looks like "tok_a1b2c3..." and is not human-readable. 
          Through this process <strong>your card details never reach our servers</strong>, the only thing passed to us is the token.
          <br />Once this token reaches our server, we use a private encryption key to ask Stripe to create a customer account and a subscription for you. 
          When Stripe sends us the confirmation that everything is OK, we then proceed to the upgrade.

          <h4>Then where do all the information on the Scheme panel comes from?</h4>
          Once again, the only thing we store is your customer number and your subscription number. Using these together with our private encryption key, 
          we ask Stripe to send us the relevant information like your invoices, some of your card details (once again, we don't have access to your full card details) 
          or the plan details. Once we receive them, we can then display them to you.
