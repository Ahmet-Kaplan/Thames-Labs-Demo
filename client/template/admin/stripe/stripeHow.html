          <h4>How do we secure your payments?</h4>
          <p>Payment security is of the utmost importance to us. Here is an overview of how we keep your card details secure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All communication between your browser and RealTimeCRM is encrypted with SSL - the same technology used to secure internet banking.</li>
            <li>We never store your card details. When you enter your card details they are encrypted and sent directly to our payment provider. Your card details are never revealed to us.</li>
            <li>Stripe, our payment provider, is industry leading and independently audited. All communication between your browser and their servers is encrypted via SSL. Your card details are then stored using the same encryption standard certified by the US Government to protect classified information.</li>
          </ul>
